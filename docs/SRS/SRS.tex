\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
Many researchers and companies want to gain information about how people travel, whether that be through the use of personal automobiles, public transit, biking, or even walking. This is because through this data you can derive insights to help inform decisions including but not limited to: public transit design, ad placement, and investment in infrastructure. \\

\noindent When the original GERT toolbox was created, there already existed software to match GPS traces to transportation networks, but the tools suffered had limited usability and functionality \cite{GISBASED}. The GERT toolbox solved this problem by extending functionality, and making the toolbox better suited for multiple input data types. Although the project was a success, it was largely inaccessible due to its reliance on the proprietary and expensive ArcGIS software. \\

\noindent The purpose of the project is to re-engineer the toolbox with a focus on on transferability, modularity, and scalability and remove reliance on any proprietary software so it can be used by a wider audience. 

\subsection{The Stakeholders}
\subsubsection{The Client}
Our main client is Dr. Antonio Paez, a professor in the School of Earth, Environment & Society at McMaster University. 

\subsubsection{The Customers}
Researchers who are interested in matching GPS data to transportation networks in the context of travel episodes and route estimation analysis. Furthermore, companies who are interested in matching GPS data for business analysis and managements. 

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
Developers, testers, and operators of this project. \textcolor{blue}{Also, the capstone professor, Dr. Smith, ad the marking teacher assistants are stakeholders as they are provide feedback and assess the progress of the project. }

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This project must be completed by the end of April, 2023.
    \item The final product must be able to run on personal laptops and desktops that uses Linux, Windows, and MacOS operating systems with Python \textcolor{blue}{3} pre-installed. \textcolor{blue}{The software works with recent versions of operating system that date from 2018-2022. 
    \item The software requires pre-installed python libraries. These libraries are geopandas, pandas, and kepler.
    \item The user will input data points via the software using csv files. This is to keep inline with the original implementation. The software will be processing these csv input filees.}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \sout{As the project is built in python, we assume that the user should be familiar with python.}
    \item Assume users are familiar with CSV files. \textcolor{blue}{ In other words, users should be able to create such files with sufficient information(e.g. latitude and longitude of the points to be dealed with) for the system to generate data.}
    \item Assume users are familiar with map files such as .shp.
\end{itemize}
%As the project is built under python, we assume that the user should be familiar with python.
% User characteristics should go under assumptions.

\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}

\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}
The current GERT toolbox is dependent on ARCGIS libraries including arcgisscripting and arcpy. The toolbox currently supports the processing inputted GPS files into
\begin{itemize}
    \item compatible data types
    \item accurate and fast choice model estimations'
    \item extracted travel episodes and information on trips
    \item potential activity locations and stops
\end{itemize}
\textcolor{blue}{The toolbox processes} millions of GPS data points quickly \textcolor{blue}{making episode information generation for a large movement session}.

    	    \label{fig: Context Diagram}
    	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\textcolor{blue}{The PyERT toolbox is the new open source toolbox that will include some of the processing functionality of the GERT toolbox without the user of ArcGIS libraries. The PyERT will support processing inputted GPS files, CSV formatted, into
\begin{itemize}
    \item compatible data types
    \item extracted travel episodes and information on trips
    \item potential activity locations and stops
\end{itemize}}

\subsubsection{Product Boundary}
The product boundary diagram was omitted due to redundancy. There are no external services/data sources that the toolbox interacts with. The toolbox may interact with an external open source GIS software, however that is a stretch goal, and should not be factored into initial designs.

\section{Likely Changes}

Automate routes using RCA
\begin{itemize}
\item Using RCA may require extra supporting requirements for functionality and could take more time given. It may not be possible to add this feature into the project.
\end{itemize}
\\
Time Use Diaries
\begin{itemize}
\item Currently users are able to input TUD episodes to generate trip segments. This might require extra supporting requirements in order to accomplish. However, based on time constraints and as it is not one of the main requirements for this project it may not be possible to add this functionality into the final product.
\end{itemize}
\\
\textcolor{blue}{GUI for open source GIS software
\begin{itemize}
\item This was mentioned as a stretch goal when the project was started. However, after getting the supervisor's, Dr. Paez, feedback, the team realized it was not appropriate to include this point part of a potential change. The open source software needs to be interactive from command-line and guided instructions of the intended uses will be provided. 
\end{itemize}
}
\section{Unlikely Changes}

Python as Primary Language
\begin{itemize}
\item Python has many libraries to facilitate mapping and analysing geospatial data which will be integral to creating this software. 
\end{itemize}
\\
GPS Coordinates as Inputs
\begin{itemize}
\item Map matching and extracting episode is dependant on GPS data gathered by the user. 
\end{itemize}
\\
GPS Episodes as Outputs 
\begin{itemize}
\item As the main requirements of the project depends on the usuage of GPS episodes the output is unlikely to change.
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Understanding the ArcGIS Architecture 
    \item Researching Similar Open Source software to ArcGIS
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
The GERT toolbox is the current solution for map matching software. However, it comes with limited functionality and specific data requirements for usage. It is also not open source and expensive to licence. 
\subsection{New Problems}
The software being created is a reworking of the original GERT toolbox and will not interfere with the original toolbox as it is designed separately from it.
\subsection{Tasks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hazard Analysis 0
    \item V&V Plan Revision 0
    \item Proof of Concept Demonstration
    \item Design Document Revision 0
    \item Revision 0 Demonstration
    \item V&V Report Revision 0
    \item Final Demonstration
    \item Expo Demonstration
    \item Final Documentation
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
\textcolor{blue}{The design architecture for the program(e.g. modular design) can ensure that it can be added with new features/function easily.}

\subsection{Risks}
\textcolor{blue}{
One potential risks is that when the user is trying to run the program in new platforms(i.e. new operation system,) he/she
may have compatibility issues.}
\subsection{Costs}
There will be no cost towards making this  toolbox as it is being created completely open source and free from proprietary software.
\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
Documentation will be made using Quarto which is open-source scientific and technical publishing system. This will allow us to put snippets of code within the documentation and will behave as a training manual for users wanting to work with the software. 
\subsection{Waiting Room}
The current plan to for project is a complete re engineering of the GERT toolbox. Once this is completed extra functionality will be added, these include: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The use of route choice analysis for trip generation 
    \item Using time use diaries for route validation 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
At this point in time we are still actively researching different libraries and frameworks to use for this project and they will be added into this section in later revisions of this document. 

\newpage

\section{Appendix}
This section has been added to the Volere template.  This is where you can place
additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the requirements will likely call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\subsection{Reflections}

To successfully complete this project \textcolor{blue}{and gain a complete understanding of the project's domain}, the team must acquire knowledge related to the content of the toolbox including but not limited to: route choice variables/models, travel episode verification and categorization, trip trajectory generation, GIS software tooling, and understanding various GPS data types. Each member of the team will be responsible for acquiring knowledge on each module of the toolbox. Smita and Moksha will be responsible for route choice variables/models. Longwei will be responsible for trip trajectory generation. Niyatha will be responsible for travel episode verification and categorization. Abeer will be responsible for GIS tooling. Nicholas will be responsible for understanding the GPS data types.\\

\noident To approach this, we meet with domain-specialists including the project's Supervisor, Dr. Paez, past developers of the toolbox, and potential toolbox users. Through interviewing these stakeholders we will learn about the goals of models we are implementing, what is lacking in current tooling, standard GIS software usage, domain specific knowledge regarding trips/routes, and how this information will be used to derive insights. We will also be reading published papers to gain insight on standard GPS data processing algorithms and help discover optimizations for our toolbox.\\

\noindent Another skill our team has to acquire is team management \textcolor{blue}{to increase the productivity of the project}. As a group project, a successful team management strategy will help members complete their tasks more efficiently. We have already established a team communication strategy and methodology for pushing/reviewing content (code, docs, etc.), to complement this, we will routinely schedule retrospectives regarding management strategies to update processes and maximize efficiency. These retrospectives will often consist of identifying productivity blockers, researching better methods, and implementing them into our tooling. \\

\noindent Another skill our team has to acquire is writing and presentation skills \textcolor{blue}{to help structure our project demonstration and supervisor's meetings}. Since every member of the team has different writing experiences, our method of writing varies drastically from person to person. Learning how to write as a team, create formal documentation that is thoroughly consistent with one another will be a challenge. Therefore we will investigate formal writing conventions and ensure that each member of the team is aware and actively uses the predetermined methods. Similarly for the end of the year capstone presentations, the team will have to work together to come up with a method of presentation that will fit all of us as well as be consistent with formal presentation styles. This will require more investigation and practise as a team.\\
