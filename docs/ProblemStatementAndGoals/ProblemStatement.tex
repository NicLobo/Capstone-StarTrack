\section{Problem Statement}



\subsection{Problem}
With the large usage of global positioning systems, software has been created to help researchers develop tools and methods based off peoples GPS data. 
One such software is the ArcPro toolbox that can match GPS traces to transportation networks. This software suffers from specific data requirements that limit usability, 
limited functionality and is not able to handle the use of larger GPS data sets. In order to overcome these weaknesses the ArcPro toolbox must be re-engineered with a focuses 
on transferability, modularity, and scalability as well as being open source without using any proprietary software.
