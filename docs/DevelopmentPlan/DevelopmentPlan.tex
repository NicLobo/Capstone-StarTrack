This document will explore the development plan of Capstone project in terms of team logistics, project design, testing plan, and project execution %A

\section{Team Meeting Plan}
The plan is to hold meetings every Monday evening from 6:30 to 7:30pm. Meetings will be conducted through Microsoft Teams or when necessary will be held in-person at McMaster's Hatch building. A meeting agenda will be established before each meeting in order to keep the meeting succinct and on track. The meetings will be used for division of labour, and completing deliverables. %S
Other meetings will be held to conduct group work sessions to complete assigned tasks. These meetings will be less formal and will be scheduled based on the project scheduling.

demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Technology}

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Libraries you will likely be using?
\item Tools you will likely be using?
